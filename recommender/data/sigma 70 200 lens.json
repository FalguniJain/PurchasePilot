            "transcript": "[Music] howdy again everyone and here is a lens that somehow i didn't end up testing for whatever reason the sigma 70 to 200 millimeter f 2.8 dg os hsm sports a few people have been requesting a review of this one so i got in touch with sigma uk who kindly loaned a copy to me for a couple of weeks for testing many thanks to them i took it on a brief little sojourn to the east coast of england for a week as well as topping off at cardiff bay on the way home and i was delighted with the sample pictures i took it's been around for a few years now being first released in 2018 and it's designed for digital slr cameras although of course it can also be mounted onto mirrorless cameras if you have the correct adapter it's not a cheap lens by any means it's about one thousand one hundred and eighty pounds in the uk or about fifteen hundred dollars in the us still that undercuts the price of canon's ef equivalent by about six hundred dollars and nikon's afs equivalent lens by about nine hundred dollars so if this sigma competitor is any good it could save you a lot of money and a 70-200 millimeter f 2.8 is probably the most important professional model of camera lens available today it's a real bread and butter lens for event photographers sports and reportage photographers and portraits and wedding photographers but it could also be used for landscape work and video making well you get the idea it is versatile and particularly when you zoom into 200 millimeter it can give you some very deeply out of focus backgrounds when it comes to build quality this lens is big and tough not to mention surprisingly weighty coming in at 1.8 kilograms or nearly four pounds that is notably more heavy than canon's ef mount 70 to 200 millimeter f 2.8 lenses which weigh nearly a pound less and canon's rf mount 70 to 200 millimeter f 2.8 weighs just over half as much so one of the main prices you'll have to pay with this sigma lens is portability it really is quite weighty putting that aside though this thing sure is tough it has weather sealing throughout including a ceiling gasket at the rear lens mount it has a heavy duty and well designed metal tripod collar although i do wish it were removable to save a bit on weight when it's not needed then you get a number of controls for auto focus and image stabilization let's look at stabilization first or os as sigma call it here is some footage with it turned off and now turned on to mode one which i found to be the most effective as you can see it's making a very nice difference indeed even at 200 millimeter your image is pretty steady although video makers might still wish to use a tripod for best results and if you have a sigma usb dock the lenses image stabilization and parts of its autofocus are customizable the rubberized focus ring works smoothly but a little heavily as this is an older lens it's physically connected to the focus mechanism not electronically connected and as a result it works quite precisely and linearly as you can see here the lens exhibits quite a bit of focus breathing zooming in quite a lot as you focus more closely no matter what focal length you're shooting at and that will annoy video makers some good news though is that the lens auto focus motor is very fast as you can see here and mostly accurate the lenses zoom ring is also rubberized and works nice and smoothly too the very end of the lens barrel is also rubberized and that's always a nice touch to me as it reduces the chances of the whole thing cracking open if you accidentally hit it against a hard surface the lens comes with one of sigma's excellent carry bags and a deep high quality lens hood which is not pictured here its filter size is a larger than usual 82 millimeters wide overall well it's fantastic build quality here but the thing is a bit heavy all right let's look at image quality can this sigma lens be competitively sharp i'll be testing it adapted onto my canon eos r5 with its challenging full frame 45 megapixel sensor in camera corrections are turned on we'll start at 70 millimeter and f 2.8 right away in the middle we see excellent sharpness and contrast the corners look virtually as sharp well a good start stop down to f4 for just a minuscule improvement there the lens tastes the sharp down to f11 but f16 looks a little softer due to the effects of diffraction let's zoom in halfway to 135 millimeter the middle of the image at f 2.8 is notably softer than at 70 millimeter but still reasonably sharp corner image quality looks about the same stop down to f4 though for excellent image quality to re-emerge from the corners and back to the middle again the image stays this sharp down to f11 and finally let's zoom all the way into 200 millimeter at f 2.8 the excellent sharpness we originally saw in the middle is thankfully back image quality over in the corners is noticeably softer than the middle but still fairly good at f4 the corners look about the same but stop down to f 5.6 or f 8 to see that excellent sharpness re-emerging overall this lens is sharp most of the time at most apertures in most areas of the image there was a little bump at 135 millimeter and f 2.8 and the corners at 200 millimeter are not razor sharp but very few people in their right mind would seriously complain because on a whole there's loads of resolution to be seen here and very good contrast all right let's turn off those in the camera corrections and take a look at distortion and vignetting at 70 millimeter we see only negligible barrel distortion here and a little darkness around the corners at f 2.8 stop down to f4 or 5.6 for those corners to brighten zoom into 200 millimeter and we are treated some moderately strong pincushion distortion at f 2.8 corners are pretty dark here stop down to f4 and we quickly see much more brightness it's an average performance for distortion and vignetting there thankfully no nasty surprises though the lenses minimum focus distance is 1.2 meters so you can get fairly close to smaller subjects at 200 millimeter at f 2.8 close-up image quality is rather soft unfortunately with blue color fringing stop down to f4 for an improvement and at 5.6 and especially f8 the image becomes very sharp again let's see how the lens works against bright light it's just an okay performance here we see some notable but not serious flaring at wider angles zoom in and it gets worse so just an average performance here i don't really test telephoto lenses for coma levels although perhaps i might do one day but i was curious about this thing's sun stars stopped under f8 and sun stars are just about beginning to form themselves here at f-16 they're looking pretty nice and at f 18 they look quite strong as you can see next bokeh for the past 10 years or so it doesn't seem to have been a problem for 70 to 200 millimeter lenses to get you some really smooth quality bokeh and this lens thankfully is no exception in all my test pictures including extra ones that didn't make it into this review this thing's out of focus backgrounds look gorgeous about as smooth and pleasing as barry white's voice anyone still listen to barry white anyway related debaca comes longitudinal chromatic aberration here's another little weak spot it's rather strong at f 2.8 with some false colors clearly emerging they remain at f4 are reduced though at 5.6 and at f 8 they are largely gone so overall the sigma 70 to 200 millimeter f 2.8 support is an excellent lens with one or two little weak points here and there its build quality is excellent it's auto focus and image stabilization very good most of all it's an impressively sharp lens with pretty gorgeously soft looking bokeh and really for a lens like this those are the key considerations for any professional photographer there are a few small niggles which for the price you're paying for the lens do prevent it from getting my highest recommendation though for example it's heavy weight it's focus breathing it's slightly weak close-up image quality and longitudinal chromatic aberration but generally speaking the lens is very sharp works very well and its price is quite acceptable if you can't quite afford an official canon on nikon 70 to 200 millimeter f 2.8 lens then this one from sigma will suit you really nicely saving you lots of money and so it still comes recommended [Music] you know what maybe i complain about heavy lenses too much i really need to work out much much more perhaps i should welcome the challenge and see it as an opportunity to build up my biceps i'm sure my wife would appreciate it anyway what definitely does not build up my biceps is sitting in my office editing exclusive videos for my patreon supporters but i'm gonna do it anyway because i really appreciate their generosity in keeping this channel going to do your bit and to get special videos and other bonus content take a look in the description below and join the gang take care and god bless everyone"

            "transcript": "hey Chris we got a new Sigma lens we got a sigma 1424 oh good so I guess that means the 7200 is coming next 90 mm 2.8 oh okay but this 7200 is coming soon right we got a 1628 2.8 that's what they came out with next 20 mm F2 huh 20 mm f1.4 wait what 17 mm F4 that's an odd Choice Chris it finally happened the Sigma 70 to 200 is here you're kidding me welcome back pet pixel viewers it is Chris Nichols here and I think as we adroitly Illustrated there it has been a bit of a weight for this lens but we finally have it the brand new segma 70 to2 200 f2.8 DG DN for mirrorless Sony e- Mount and L Mount and why this is a big deal is because in this time that we've been waiting of course we've had Sony I mean 7200 G Master version one and version 2 Tamron 70 to 180 version one and then G2 Panasonic have a 7200 f2.8 for the El Mount but we have not seen anything from Sigma since the SLR days the long weight is finally over here we go let's take a look at [Music] it [Music] so the first issue that I want to address is the first thing that I noticed about the sigma 7200 2.8 when I first picked it up and that's just that it's quite heavy so to give you guys context the sigma 702 200f 2.8 dgn we're looking at 1350 G roughly okay and that's you know just under a plan and a half but if I compare that to then this Sony GM 7200 2.8 version 2 that lens is only 1,45 G I mean just over a planet I mean it's noticeably lighter and then I compare that to the Tamron g270 to 180 f2.8 that I just recently played with that thing's 855 gram so substantially lighter and so when I picked this up I really noticed it that being said when we take a look at this versus the Panasonic L Mount 70 to 200f 2.8 that lens is still over 1500 G so I think maybe what Sigma is trying to do is not necessarily get lighter than the e-mount but absolutely try to again under what the Panasonic 7200 offers for weight okay so let's talk about the rest of the handling on the sigma 7200 starting at the front here and working our way back the first thing thing I notice here is the hood it's not a one button quick release press it's just a screw lock and twist I don't mind that I mean I can position it wherever I want and it is secure I also like that the Hood's got this rubberized material on the front when I put the lens down and stuff it just like that it doesn't wear at the hood oddly enough though when it is mounted you'll notice that it goes over the zoom ring a bit so I'm constantly thinking like oh is my hood reversed or not it's not I can assure you otherwise we have a 77 mm filter thread here in the front Okay so next thing we have is the zoom ring here and and with the hood in the way there I do like that at least it stops my fingers naturally if I'm moving up to find the zoom ring but I also find because the hood the zoom ring is somewhat narrow there to grab but it works just fine custom buttons here and you can customize those for a couple functions and then choose to switch that here right on the side of the lens then I've got my manual focus ring and interestingly enough we do have an actual aperture ring on here it's got nice solid click stops I can lock it into auto mode if I want and I can also declick that apertur ring if I want to be smooth and silent now something that I complained about on the Tamron 70 to 180 G2 was its lack of button controls it had a very simplified structure here and I far prefer having something like this on the sigma I like having my classic autofocus manual focus switch Focus limiter I like that the tripod color has the 90\u00b0 Dayton clicks I always enjoy that and it does have Dov tail cut for ARCA Swift style tripod heads that's a nice bonus as well this lens is fully weather sealed and it absolutely feels solid I mean it's metal construction it's rugged everything tight so yes the sigma 7200 f2.8 is a heavy lens and heavier than I would want it to be honestly but I don't feel like I'm missing out anything that I would normally appreciate on a professional 2.8 telephoto lens so when it comes to autofocusing Sigma using their twin H high-speed linear actuators just like Tamron would use their twin linear voice coil Motors just like Sony would use their twin XD linear motor the fact is all these modern professional lenses have fast linear actuators and and on the sigma 7200 I'm finding again very quick response from things that are close minimum focusing distance to infinity and back so Snappy ideal for sports street photography any sort of portraiture and journalism work you might want to do now the ton 70 to 1880 G2 they were advertising that at 70 mm you could get very close to your subject like 11 in away and do some pseudo macro kind of stuff and I only bring it up because I want to see what's the sigma 7200 like in comparison well this certainly has more working distance you get your best macro at 200 mm not 70 mm your working distance is just under 40 in however we're getting over 1 to five life- siiz reproduction for macro so the occasional shot where you want to simplify your composition and have something closeup kind of stand up for the background sure but I would not call it a macro lens in any way shape or form and if you're trying to get shots of portraits where you just want the eyes or something you're going to have to crop bouquet time Sigma 7200 2.8 looks like it has beautiful bouquet specular highlights as you can see here slight soap bubble effect but no onion rings whatsoever and I'm getting nice transitions from INF Focus to autofocus areas there's definitely distinct cat ey effect at f2.8 but again I don't really mind that with the telephoto lens especially something for portraits where you can in some cases use those specular highlights to give a cool swirly effect stop down things do get nice and round we're not noticing any weird polygonal shapes although even stopped down to f4.5 I'm still getting a fair amount of that cat ietting in the corner Loca time let's talk about longitudinal chromatic aberration this is where shallow depth the field out of focus areas will pick up a color cast usually like a green magenta split it's very hard to get rid of impost so you don't want it fortunately Sigma professional lenses generally don't suffer from Loca and it's the same thing here you can see that any loc is incredibly minimal we're not really getting those Color cast so no issues to worry about in post so you may or may have noticed it's been an ugly cloudy day all day today but look the sun's just broken out you can see it on my face right now so time to talk about flar as we got some test shots here so you know sigas have always been really good at controlling flare this lens seems to be no exception shooting wide open at f2.8 you can see we're not really losing any contrast it's still really good stopping the lens down we get some ghost slightly but very unobtrusive so classic Sigma excellent control when shooting towards bright light sources all right let's talk about the sigma 7200 in terms of its video capabilities cuz first off we've got some really nice benefits as I've said before the manual focus ring smooth well dampened we also have an aperture ring which is great and we can declick that these are all big benefits for video Shooters but most importantly does this lens breathe well as you can see here in the example no not really at all now the fact that this lens basically has no breathing issues is less important for El Mount because the competition the Panasonic 7200 is also well corrected but this is very handy to have in Sony e-mount because typically the lenses you you'll find the Sony G Masters the Tamron 7180 they do have a little bit of breathing that takes place so this now gives you an option if you absolutely don't want any at all all right so it's time to find out does the sigma 7200 even sharp bro that makes that's how kids talk right so sharpness wise let's do our usual thing looking at the test chart here we're going to start at 70 mm in the center shooting wide open at f2.8 Fantastic detail very impressed I honestly didn't notice really any improvements stopping down to f5.6 uh where I did notice Improvement was in the corners you can see her 70 mm f2.8 Corners are still decent but by stopping down we got a little bit more contrast and a little bit more sharpness now take a look at 200 mm pretty similar story Center at f2.8 decent detail here I did notice that stopping down gave me a little Improvement in sharpness contrast was already good and same story for the corners f2.8 at 200 mm little bit soft not bad at all but stopping down you do notice an improvement okay so time to take a look at how the sigma 72 2.8 pairs against its contemporaries and I don't mean Sigma contemporary lenses it's a very confusing naming structure I mean contemporary lenses from like Sony and you know Panasonic and Tamron anyways so here's what I would say I mean first off no lens really does compare and sharpness to the Sony G Master version 2 I would say that is still going to be the most expensive but optically best lens we're going to see at 7200 as far as sharpness goes but I would say this is very comparable to the Tamron uh especially at 70 mm the Tamron does seem to me to be just a hair sharper at 180 mm than this is at 200 mm that being said I would still happily shoot the sigma 7200 wide open throughout its range I think you're still going to get professional results okay but what about an LM Mount this lens versus the Panasonic 702 2.8 well we never shot the 70 to 200 2.8 Panasonic on test charts and certainly not the same test charts we use today so it wouldn't quite be fair that way however I do remember the Panasonic 7200 2.8 being a good lens and a sharp lens absolutely but a subst stantially more expensive lens than the sigma if it is sharper than this lens I don't think it's necessarily worth the extra cost and honestly I think the sigma is sharper anyways which makes this definitely the more practical choice so what I buy this lens let's talk about L Mount first because compared to the Panasonic 702 2.8 this is optically a fantastic lens with no breathing it's got great controls it is heavy but lighter than the Panasonic 70 22.8 and it's far less money so yes absolutely I think if you're looking for for an L Mount 7200 2.8 this is the right way to go but what about versus other Sony ount options I know I've been comparing this Sigma against the Tamron 70 180 G2 a lot and that's because well of course they're both third party options for Sony e-mount but they're also very similar pricing I will say that having used this all day the only thing about the handling that still kind of rubs me the wrong way is the zoom ring I still find it's weird with the hood there it feels strange I don't know is I'm not getting used to it but I do really like all of the extra controls on this Sigma that's something I don't like about the Tamron that being said I feel like the Tamron I'm giving up 20 mm in the long range but I'm gaining a little bit better Optical sharpness it's basically the same kind of bouquet same kind of flare resistance and Optical performance but it's way smaller and it's way lighter and it's still well built and rugged I do find that I tend to be more biased towards compact gear I like lighter weight stuff that's easier to carry around but I really think the Tamron for me is probably the better choice when it comes to the Sony GM of course that's going to be a big jump up in price but it does dominate optically in pretty much every way shape and form and on top of that remember that both the tamon and the sigma especially you're using more of the faster Sony sports related cameras will be cap at shooting 15 frames per second with continuous autofocus going so that might be a consideration as well but no matter how you look at it although we've been waiting a long time for this lens it is finally here and I think sigma's done a great job delivering us a fantastic professional lens for a very good price no matter how you

            "transcript": "the brand new Sigma 70 to 200 mm f2.8 is here and\u00a0\nit's packed with a lot of exciting things and in\u00a0\u00a0 this video will not only be taking a closer look\u00a0\nat it but will'll also answer questions such as\u00a0\u00a0 how good is it actually in real life situations\u00a0\nand is it really worth your money on top of that\u00a0\u00a0 I'll also be sharing with you guys two things\u00a0\nthat I think are absolutely fantastic about it\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's one thing that I don't really\u00a0\nlike so by the end of this video you'll know\u00a0\u00a0 exactly if this lens right here is the perfect\u00a0\nlens for you so this is actually not the sigma\u00a0\u00a0 art lens but a sigma sport lens and for the last\u00a0\n3 days I've been playing around with it and in my\u00a0\u00a0 opinion it's surprisingly good and you know it's\u00a0\nbeen really fun to use it and put it to the test\u00a0\u00a0 for both photos and videos however I might have\u00a0\na few comments about it regarding all of that\u00a0\u00a0 but before we dive into just that then my friends\u00a0\nlet's first take a look at the build quality and\u00a0\u00a0 what this lens actually has to offer so as you can\u00a0\nsee this lens it's quite big it's actually 1,340\u00a0\u00a0 G what it is in American terms I'm not sure but\u00a0\nI'll put it on the screen but overall a fantastic\u00a0\u00a0 and a well-built design that's weather sealed and\u00a0\nreally sturdy I this is I I have not dropped it so\u00a0\u00a0 don't take my word for it I'm not going to drop\u00a0\nit because it's not mine Sigma lent it to me as\u00a0\u00a0 you can see it of course Sports Sigma signature\u00a0\nmatte black look that pairs really well with my\u00a0\u00a0 Sony camera and I think the entire look it looks\u00a0\njust super slick and beautiful at least in my\u00a0\u00a0 opinion now you have a aperture ring right here\u00a0\nthat uh like feels really good and a focus ring\u00a0\u00a0 here that also feel good and then the new thing\u00a0\nif we take this a little bit up just like so we\u00a0\u00a0 take this lens sorry about this you know and then\u00a0\nup here you have a zoom ring and this is actually\u00a0\u00a0 the new thing about this camera and it also feels\u00a0\ngood I mean the entire feeling of this lens feels\u00a0\u00a0 quality then if you take a the look at down here\u00a0\nyou have a bunch of these knobs you have can take\u00a0\u00a0 off the clicking of the apertur ring so if you're\u00a0\nfilming and you don't want the have this beautiful\u00a0\u00a0 sound this sound that I do appreciate but when\u00a0\nyou're filming we don't like that you can take\u00a0\u00a0 that off you have some custom modes that you can\u00a0\nput on here you have the OS the stabilizer you\u00a0\u00a0 can take it on and off you have Focus limiter and\u00a0\nof course switching between autofocus and manual\u00a0\u00a0 focus then you also have this thing I'm not sure\u00a0\neven what this is called but this is for when you\u00a0\u00a0 have it on the tripod and the it turns 180\u00b0 but\u00a0\nthere is one thing that I think is super nice here\u00a0\u00a0 is that it clicks when it turns 90\u00b0 so when you\u00a0\nhave have it on the tripod and you want to switch\u00a0\u00a0 your camera to you know horizontal or vertical\u00a0\nit's very easy cuz it clicks there buam buam\u00a0\u00a0 it's a nice little detail however you cannot take\u00a0\nthis thing off easily which personally I think is\u00a0\u00a0 pretty lame you need like screwdrivers if you\u00a0\nwant to take it on and off on the Sony you have\u00a0\u00a0 this quick release system which is nice because\u00a0\nthen it like if you want to fit it in the bag and\u00a0\u00a0 you don't really always need this in a unit then\u00a0\nyou can just easily take it off now the rear it\u00a0\u00a0 looks like this here and then we have the this\u00a0\nlens hood that you screw off like this the lens\u00a0\u00a0 Hood then is has a rubber here so when you put\u00a0\nit on the table or whatever it's not you're not\u00a0\u00a0 you know scratching the plastic now in my opinion\u00a0\nI'm not a huge fan of this actually then I'm not\u00a0\u00a0 a fan of that screwing system at all I think it's\u00a0\nslow and clunky and uh yeah it just takes a whole\u00a0\u00a0 lot of time now I get that this is just a personal\u00a0\npreference and I did ask Sigma about it and they\u00a0\u00a0 said that this is like a more durable system than\u00a0\nwhat you have on like regulars like this however\u00a0\u00a0 this has never break broken for me and yeah again\u00a0\njust a point of preference but this is my opinion\u00a0\u00a0 but as I said before then I've been playing a\u00a0\nlot around with this lens for both photos and\u00a0\u00a0 videos and I am surprisingly impressed so if we\u00a0\nstart with the photos then the images turn out\u00a0\u00a0 really sharp even at f2.8 and my friends you can\u00a0\nget some serious pokeballs Pok\u00e9balls pokeballs we\u00a0\u00a0 like Pokeballs and pokeballs if you're a '90s baby\u00a0\nlike me now person personally I'm not that much\u00a0\u00a0 of a port photographer but I did ask my friend\u00a0\nBrandon to posee for me and the images as you can\u00a0\u00a0 see here they turned out pretty great so like if\u00a0\na wear of Port photographer this is a great lens\u00a0\u00a0 for that I mean the 70 to 200 mm it's good it's\u00a0\nnice for portraits now we get a little uh padrick\u00a0\u00a0 coming in now where were we now one thing I want\u00a0\nyou guys to keep in mind is that this lens right\u00a0\u00a0 here this is actually a prototype and the like\u00a0\nfinal result when they release it it will have\u00a0\u00a0 some updated firm or anything like that so sigo\u00a0\nspecifically told me remember this is a prototype\u00a0\u00a0 if there is any wrongness it will be fixed but\u00a0\nup until this point I personally haven't found\u00a0\u00a0 anything that I think or or have I maybe let's\u00a0\nsee so the chromatic operation I have no idea\u00a0\u00a0 how to pronounce that word aeration but the like\u00a0\ncolor fringes it's really well controlled I am not\u00a0\u00a0 really seeing a lot I tried it shooting you know\u00a0\nthree branches which usually is like where I in\u00a0\u00a0 my opinion at least for me where the cameras\u00a0\nhave the hardest time you know with that and\u00a0\u00a0 I'm assuming in this is totally unedited photo\u00a0\nand I'm like I don't are you seeing it I'm not\u00a0\u00a0 really seeing a whole lot of it so uh very well\u00a0\ncontrolled and good job there Sigma another thing\u00a0\u00a0 that the photos I've been showing you these\u00a0\nare mostly like pretty high ISO like thousand\u00a0\u00a0 plus the reason for it is been like pretty dark\u00a0\nand like dull days so I had to like cuz shooting\u00a0\u00a0 hand a lot then I had to like pump up the iso a\u00a0\nlittle bit another thing I was looking for is to\u00a0\u00a0 see if there are any vignetting and I'm personally\u00a0\nnot seeing any like vignetting at all how are you\u00a0\u00a0 let me know in the comments down below but I did\u00a0\nhowever do a little test where I saw a tiny bit of\u00a0\u00a0 winette and you can see the difference when we go\u00a0\ndown to 2.8 in this scenario here there's a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of vignette compared to F4 or like the higher\u00a0\nF stuffs but this is totally normal and yeah it's\u00a0\u00a0 not that noticeable and to my eye it's also pretty\u00a0\nsharp across the entire image sometimes when you\u00a0\u00a0 have lenses they can be like more sharp in the\u00a0\nmiddle or whatever but here is like pretty even\u00a0\u00a0 sharpness even sharpness smack the like button for\u00a0\nme while I have your attention I did also take it\u00a0\u00a0 out to the streets and had a fantastic time this\u00a0\nis definitely MD when it comes to entertainment\u00a0\u00a0 taking photos I wish I had more time with this\u00a0\nlens I wish I would able to you know go to the\u00a0\u00a0 mountains but I do live in Stockholm Sweden and\u00a0\nthere are no Mountains close by and I'm not going\u00a0\u00a0 to Iceland until next month to visit my friends\u00a0\nand family there but with that being said street\u00a0\u00a0 photography is also fun and there are a lot of\u00a0\ncool shots that I managed to get with the sigma\u00a0\u00a0 you know that I'm holding right here and that\u00a0\nthis entire video is about and the reason you\u00a0\u00a0 clicked here on top of that the autofocus is\u00a0\nalso fast and accurate however when I was in\u00a0\u00a0 the forest and it was extremely quiet around me\u00a0\nI did hear a slight you know how do you explain\u00a0\u00a0 this a slight sound in it like they was trying\u00a0\nto catch Focus or thinking like it's not enough\u00a0\u00a0 for I don't think the microphone will pick it\u00a0\nup and when I was here in the studio or in the\u00a0\u00a0 city I didn't hear it at all but when it was\u00a0\nsuper quiet then I did hear a slight sound I\u00a0\u00a0 just wanted to add that there now this was all\u00a0\nabout photography when it came to video however\u00a0\u00a0 that's where things you know became in my opinion\u00a0\nreally interesting but first before we dive into\u00a0\u00a0 that little rabbit hole then if you want to take\u00a0\nyour content to the next level fast and I'm not\u00a0\u00a0 joking here because I've personally experienced\u00a0\nthis myself then what I'm about to show you now\u00a0\u00a0 and tell you is 100% for you because this episode\u00a0\nright here is sponsored by Yours Truly myself so\u00a0\u00a0 for the last year or so my notion template has\u00a0\nchanged the ENT entire game for me when it comes\u00a0\u00a0 to creating content and honestly revolutionized\u00a0\nhow I script my videos and not only that it also\u00a0\u00a0 allowed me to track my YouTube projects and\u00a0\nso much more so I can confidently say that\u00a0\u00a0 this system if you used correctly can 100% elevate\u00a0\nyour YouTube game as well so if you want to take\u00a0\u00a0 your YouTube scripting game to the very next\u00a0\nlevel and your content game in general then\u00a0\u00a0 in the description down below there is a link and\u00a0\nthere's even a 50-minute long tutorial that comes\u00a0\u00a0 with the template just to make sure my friend\u00a0\nthat you get the most out of it right away so\u00a0\u00a0 for the video quality and by the way I realized\u00a0\nthroughout this entire you know my own ad read I\u00a0\u00a0 was holding the lens here and it's a little bit\u00a0\nheavy you know I'm strong you you can use this\u00a0\u00a0 as a little you know dumpel but enough of this\u00a0\nnonsense here where are my notes now for video\u00a0\u00a0 it's been incredibly enjoyable to use the uh like\u00a0\nimage quality and the footage it comes out sharp\u00a0\u00a0 as you can see here you even get some beautiful\u00a0\nlike Pok\u00e9balls we do like Pok\u00e9balls and whenever\u00a0\u00a0 I say Pok\u00e9balls I just go to think pokeballs got\u00a0\nto get them all one thing that I was personally\u00a0\u00a0 like interested in seeing was like do I need to\u00a0\nhold the lens entire time like one thing that I\u00a0\u00a0 was personally like interested in seeing with this\u00a0\ncamera was to see how good is the autofocus in the\u00a0\u00a0 no video aspect and as you can see with the video\u00a0\nthrowing up it it tracks me fast it's accurate I\u00a0\u00a0 also wanted to see like when we switch the focus\u00a0\nfrom one subject to to the other how is it like\u00a0\u00a0 handling that is it is it jittery or there too\u00a0\nmuch like Focus breathing and I think that it\u00a0\u00a0 like turned out pretty good there might be it\u00a0\nmight be a little bit too fast at times but\u00a0\u00a0 I think this is also some settings that I can\u00a0\nchange within my camera so I have absolutely no\u00a0\u00a0 complaints there and lately when I've been trying\u00a0\nout like these third party lenses especially from\u00a0\u00a0 Sigma then I think that the autofocus like I'm\u00a0\nnot seeing a huge difference between the autof\u00a0\u00a0 focus on them and on the native Sony lenses I mean\u00a0\nthey they've dialed in good I think like this out\u00a0\u00a0 of focus was bad on third party Sigma lenses back\u00a0\nin the day I'm not sure I'm not saying anything\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not saying anything but in my experience\u00a0\nfor the newest models that I've tried they've\u00a0\u00a0 all been like fantastic now I was also trying to\u00a0\nlook for any type of distortions both for photos\u00a0\u00a0 and videos and personally I'm not really seeing\u00a0\nanything here I'm looking for like viting I'm\u00a0\u00a0 looking for some like barel Distortion or or like\u00a0\nconcussion distortions some type of distortions\u00a0\u00a0 I'm looking for like if the it's uneven sharpness\u00a0\nor whatever or if the images aren't sharp and I I\u00a0\u00a0 am not seeing anything but I'm not nitpicking\u00a0\ntoo much I'm not too much of a nerd but what\u00a0\u00a0 do you think like feel free to let me know in\u00a0\nthe comments down below if if I'm just here uh\u00a0\u00a0 like saying some [\u00a0__\u00a0] or if you actually can\u00a0\nsee anything that is isn't as good like we are\u00a0\u00a0 here making this community together and Together\u00a0\nWe Grow you know now when it comes to the price\u00a0\u00a0 then at the time of the recording the price isn't\u00a0\nyet available I I don't even know the price but\u00a0\u00a0 the beauty of editing is the fact that we can jump\u00a0\nbetween space and time so welcome to the Future my\u00a0\u00a0 friend and here the price of the sigma is $1,499\u00a0\nthis is pricing seeing online and I think it's\u00a0\u00a0 pretty damn good considering what you can get\u00a0\nI mean the Sony it's a lot more expensive and\u00a0\u00a0 I just like want to again emphasize on the fact\u00a0\nthat I do think the sigma is a fantastic Glens\u00a0\u00a0 it's Racor sharp and just it handled everything\u00a0\nthat threw at it like pretty damn good however\u00a0\u00a0 what camera should you be using it with and if\u00a0\nyou're a beginner what camera should you use well\u00a0\u00a0 if you want to know the answer to that question\u00a0\nthe next you should watch this video right here"

it hit send it and I will send you a free guide to capturing motion in low light situations [Music] jared polin froknowsphoto.com and this is a review of the sigma 70 to 200 2.8 os sport lens verse the Canon 70 to 200 2.8 version 3 is now I took these lenses out into the real world to photograph women's basketball at Temple University I used two different cameras I use the EOS R as well as the 6d mark 2 now the reason that I did that is because I wanted to natively put it on an EF mount camera which is the 60 mark - which by the way doesn't have the greatest focusing points in the world they're all clumped in the middle which made things a little more difficult but I also wanted to put it on the EOS R with the EF lens adapter so I'm taking a third-party lens the Sigma and adapting it to the EOS R and seeing how the results looked now the same thing happened with the Canon lens I put that on both of these cameras but it's native and they're supposed to just work and we will go over more of that as I go through the images I also I'm going to end up going upstairs to my computer to do a side-by-side comparison a more closer look between some of the files so we can try to determine which lens is better if any of them are actually better and as always you can download sample RAW files over on the website the link is down below so you can analyze them for yourself see if you like the Sigma better or if you like the Canon now is a good time to remind you that I've done reviews of the Tamron 7200 2.8 G 2 verse the Nikon as well as doing a Nikon 7200 2.8 VR review those are both linked down below now keep in mind this Sigma lens comes in a couple of different versions it's just that the Nikon one hasn't been released yet at the time of recording this and the one well we haven't actually heard anything about that just yet but this lens is available in Sigma mount for any of the four people that own a sigma mount camera now let's talk about pricing the Sigma comes in at 1500 bucks for a 70 to 200 2.8 the canon version is two thousand and ninety nine dollars so you can see that is a six hundred dollar difference but the nikon version comes in at $2,800 verse the $1,500 for the sigma version when you get that on an F mount for Nikon also there's another lens to talk about that's the Tamron 70 to 200 2.8 G to that lens comes in at 1300 bucks so that's something for you to keep in mind if you're looking for a third-party lens now is a good time to mention that if you're looking to purchase any of these lenses or any camera gear for that matter use our link at adorama it's adorama.com slash fro when you use that link it helps us to continue to make these videos and make these reviews now let's talk about weight this Sigma over here is heavy three point nine seven pounds or 1.8 kilos which is a lot of coke which would be probably a lot more expensive than 1500 hours but I've never done coke so I don't actually know how much coke cost even you know how much coke now Steven doesn't know either so the canon one weighs in at 3.2 six pounds or fourteen hundred and eighty grams there is a noticeable difference when you pick these lenses up you can feel the heft in both of them but the Sigma definitely feels slightly heavier which makes it a little more difficult when you're out there shooting also this Sigma lens has an 82 millimeter filter thread that means there's a lot of glass in this camera that's part of the reason it's slightly heavier the Canon the Tamron the Nikon there's 77 millimeter filter threads is one better than the other it's possible with the more glass you may get better results in something like the Sigma but when we look at some of these images from the game shot with the Sigma they look fantastic look at this shot right here zooming in on her face she looks sharp she looks great now if you're noticing there's some noise in the images well let me explain to you my settings real fast I was at one one thousandth of a second at 2.8 at ISO 3200 both the eos r and the 60 mark ii are well capable of capturing images that are clean and usable at that is so now the reason i'm at one one thousandth of a second to shoot sports i want to freeze the action so I have no problem bumping the ISO up a little higher in order to help me get the results that I'm looking for I also shot most of the game with the VR on or so sorry the OS on and the is on Nikon does the VR and Tamron does the vc but they all do the same thing but you also want to keep in mind that neither of these two Canon cameras have built-in image stabilization in them so you're just relying on what is in the lens's no I was sitting on the baseline and I stayed there the entire game because I wanted to try and get similar images with the Canon lens as well as the Sigma lens but I spent most of the game shooting with the Sigma because that's really the more important thing to see is how well that lens did and then get some comparison shots as best as possible with the Canon version also I wanted to run through both of the camera so we can see the different results that you would get from the 60 mark - and the EOS are especially knowing that the EOS R isn't really designed to shoot fast I'm gonna show you this right now I'll opt through 20 photos in a row with the EOS R and the 70 to 200 Sigma and it only missed let's see right about here you can see that it's missed to the background slightly the the player running as well as the second shot but it looks like 18 of the shots in a row were perfectly fine and that's an interesting camera to shoot at 5 frames a second because you do not have a full live view you have the pictures that you're taking and they kind of just herky-jerky Li jump across the screen as you get it but I was able to get the focus right thankfully to the camera and the focus system and my ability to move the focusing points quickly with the touchpad on the back of the camera so in that situation it did really well it's very difficult to sit here and say that one was better than the other especially when using it in the real world situation as well as looking at some of the sample images for example we have a shot like this where I shot through the subjects somebody out-of-focus drawing me in and this is done with the cannon and it looks it looks great but I will tell you that the color seemed very similar the sharpness seems very similar so that's a good sign for the less expensive lens here's something interesting about the Sigma that I'm not really a big fan of well actually I like the fact that it has a built-in arca-swiss plate which means if you're gonna put it on a tripod or a monopod though I don't recommend shooting a 70 to 200 on a monopod you should be able to handhold this in just about every situation no matter who you are even if you have small hands and you can't lift a lot you should be able to handhold this when you're shooting the arca-swiss plate comes off not easily you need to literally wrench these bad boys out of there to take it off which means you're not gonna be able to put it on quickly whereas with the Canon now I'm being careful because I don't want to knock anything on the floor you can loosen this line up the red dots you can pop it off I personally do not use this at all with my Nikon I always take this off I know this is the Canon lens I'll show you the Nikon in a second but if you're gonna be shooting video and you need to put it onto a tripod you're gonna go ahead and want to put this back on so I'm gonna put that bad boy down below and I want to just show you one more thing with the Nikon version now the Nikon ring doesn't actually come off either oh my god this is so much lighter this is so much lighter than the other two this doesn't come off it rotates but the foot does come off you can then press a button right here somewhere there it is the foot comes off the ring can stay because all you need to do is push the foot back on we did notice though that when using this sometimes if it's not fully tight you may get a little wobble in the plate so that's something to keep in mind I've talked about this a lot with the Nikon version because I hate the fact that the Rings are on the outside which means I can't tuck my elbows as much and keep it in closer to use this as the zoom ring when they make this the zoom ring also you'll notice that it's much tighter than the Canon version so that means you have to ramp your fingers down and actually exert some force to turn it from 70 to 200 now that's partly because of the weather sealing is really good in this lens but I found that in the third-party lenses like the tamarins and the Sigma's that it's much more difficult to turn these zoom rings then it is in something like this Canon right here the zoom rings closer I can use my thumb and I don't really have to press my forefinger because it just works much smoother and much easier and this is a weather sealed lens as well I prefer it closer to me I've talked about that a lot I also think that in the future most of the lenses like 70 to 200 are going to move the zoom ring to the outside let me jump in here real quick since we're talking about camera gear and asked you have you downloaded my gear vault yet it's the best way to input organize and protect your gear and it's absolutely free you can also get an insurance quote which is what I've done and I've gotten insurance through the app just in case I break something or it gets stolen I am protected so now let's get back to the video let's jump into a couple of more sample images right here this one was done 60 mark 2 as well with the 70-200 2.8 sport lens and as i zoom in it's just the colors look great the sharpness is spot-on I just it's amazing when you can take a third-party lens in this day and age and you wonder is it really third-party anymore because on the new Ellyn mount alliance it's going to be a first-party lens on that type of system it almost begs the question is are these Sigma lens is starting to become better than the Canon version for a hell of a lot less I'd be curious where the money difference is is it build quality because the build quality seems really good and the sport lenses and the contemporaries and the art lenses have all been put together very well over the last 6 years since they started to introduce them but the colors and the tones look great on this camera now let me jump over to one that was taken with the EOS R this is what the EOS are and as you zoom in on her face you're like is it focused I really do think it is but let's go down the ball sharp the feet sharp the leg sharp this is definitely usable and as you zoom in closer you may go is it out I actually don't think it is I think it could be slightly sharper but you see their sharpness in the photo in places where it really matters I think a lot of this comes down to the camera using the EOS R to shoot action and being able to move those focusing points is a little more difficult and using the 60 mark - on the other hand is definitely more difficult honestly I know this isn't a review about these two cameras but the EOS r's quality even though it's not really meant for shooting sports still ended up giving me better images than the 60 mark - but really do you see much of a difference looking at these two images and go well that was definitely the sigma and that was definitely the canon i didn't feel that at all while i was shooting this is done with the 70 to 200 canon this one looks great I love the clarity on this the color the tones look very nice but then switching to the next image you're like it's not the Canon it's actually the Sigma and as you zoom in she is super duper sharp the colors look good the bokeh in the background looks great and I really can't complain about either of the lenses even adapting it to the EOS R which is something that people are going to want to know the Nikon should adapt perfectly well to the z6 and the z7 and get image stabilization built into the body now the reason I bring up the Nikon version is because Sigma makes this lens for nikon it's just not out at this time and when it does come out I'll put it side by side against the 70 to 200 2.8 Nikon as well now some people may be wondering how does this Sigma lens work for video while handheld while I put it on the EOS R to shoot some of the game with this lens and it did very well I was surprised how well it kept up with the action even on the EOS R with an adapter with the OS on I did a little bit of samples with it off to see what would happen it definitely wasn't as stable and you can see it when I go from off to on it was just much more stable obviously having it on now I wish the cannon had it built into their bodies the image stabilization but with that being said it did do a very good job so you got to see some of the images right here but I do want to take it upstairs to my desk to analyze the images closer and put them side-by-side so that you can get a closer look to decide whether or not you like them and if the third-party lens in the Sigma is perfect for you so now let's jump up to upstairs so here I am upstairs at the factory in front of the computer as you can tell so let's take a closer look at a couple of these images and then put a few of them side-by-side to see if we can really see a difference so let's take a look at this shot one one-thousandth at f28 3200 ISO 114 millimeters with the Sigma Sport lens on the 60 mark - which as we know is a little more difficult to focus with but it nailed this look how sharp the ball is look how sharp the faces look at the nice colors we got a purple Jersey we got yellow on there sharp all the way through you've got the nice bokeh in the background I mean I would prefer being able to blow that out more but if I was zoomed in any further I would have cut something off when she took this shot so being at 114 millimeters was where I needed to be but this looks great moving on to the next one can we tell the difference I mean it's in a different part of the arena but this one was done with the Canon I will say that I couldn't really tell the difference when auto focusing between the Canon and the Sigma they both did a great job on both the EOS R and the 6d mark - it would be very difficult to sit there and say well one focused better than the other because they both just focus and they both just nailed the differences are the weight and the zoom ring on the outside I absolutely despise the zoom ring on the outside like I said but when you zoom in on the shot it's spot-on you can see that she's sweating you can see the eye is nice and sharp the ball is well looked the ball looks a little wobbly but yeah moving on to the next shot I shot this one at 70 millimeters with the 70 to 200 Sigma sport lens so it's obviously wider but right under the basket oh this is done with the EOS R as well so it looks great got my focusing point where I needed it you have the girls going up for the rebound I don't think it was a shot unless you got totally smashed trying to get that shot and then went to the line but it looks it looks spot-on focused wise right where it needs to be right here the ball everything looks good color looks good tones look good and it's not the easiest of situations to shoot in keep in mind I'm in a gymnasium they do have better LED lights that they were placed in there but I'm still at 3200 ISO at one one thousandth of a second and I can't tell the difference between which lens shot which image and on which body it it doesn't really matter they seem to be working very well but this is where we can take a look at something keep in mind these are not edited but we do have 14 custom Lightroom presets that if you would like to try them out and see how they work head on over to froknowsphoto.com slash presets where they are currently on sale so go ahead and take advantage of that if you'd like to press one button two buttons or get a great starting point with your images fro pack one maybe for you now here are these two shots we've got them side-by-side right here on the Left we have the Sigma and on the right we have the Canon so as i zoom in we can see that the Canon is super-duper-duper sharp we can see that the Sigma looks like I hit the eyelashes this is on the 60 mark to both of them this is my focus miss on the one it's not the lens missing because we know the lens can hit it's not easy to shoot the same subject with two different lenses while you switch to one and switch the other and have her stay in the same exact area it just so happened that I hit it with the Canon easier than I did with the Sigma but it looks so sharp on the one side now let me jump over to line up these other two images so we'll put these together side by side we've got the Sigma on the left and we've got the Canon on the right you can see that her eye is turned this way so it's better but you can also see that I her nose here so if we just look at the nose and we look at the at the skin I mean that's my answer I wish I would have hit the focus there so it would be more representative but you saw my focus during the game it was nailed I nailed it with the Sigma and nailed it with the Canon and it's very difficult to sit here and tell you that one is better than the other one using it in the real world situation to wrap it up there's a couple of things to keep in mind when you're making the decision on whether to go with the Sigma or to go with the Canon in this particular situation you've got price $600 difference you've got some of the focus ring turning the fact that you can't take the ring off the bottom unless you unscrew the the mount plate and you've got the weight it's heavier but in this day and age just more expensive mean better I know from personal experience using the Canon 70 to 200 version 1 version 2 and version 3 that I consider those lenses well now the version 3 to be the sharpest 70 to 200 I've ever used it's a fantastic lens it's worth the price of two thousand and ninety nine dollars but if you're just starting out looking for your very first 70 to 200 2.8 you don't have to spend the two thousand plus dollars when you could spend fifteen hundred dollars still have five hundred dollars to play around with to get another good piece of glass it makes it hard for me to say go Canon if I was a full-time professional I'm still probably buying the Canon because it's a little smaller and lighter and it still has the zoom ring in closer but at the end of the day you're not going wrong with either of those don't forget you can download sample RAW files you can pixel people you can see which one is best for you leave me some comments down below with which one you think is better and which one you would go with don't forget to Like share comment and subscribe if you haven't already done so and I'm gonna leave it right there thank you very much for watching jared polin froknowsphoto.com see ya [Music] you [Applause] [Music]"

            "transcript": "this is a lens that so many Sony users have been waiting for and it's only $1,500 and you're getting damn near G Master performance now before we get started this video is brought to you by my color grading presets for Lightroom um I just released a new set of color grading presets that are specifically for Studio portraits now whether you want to make the skin pop or you want to just reduce those pesky orange undertones that come with using artificial light these are going to be perfect for you check it out link will be in the description when I first held this lens in my hand the thing that stood out to me first was how they designed the zoom ring instead of it being more in the middle like the Sony it's at the end of the barrel and you have to turn it the opposite direction so that on the sigma you're turning it counterclockwise to zoom which when you think of it it actually makes sense if you're using this lens with the tripod collar at the bottom the zooming being at the end of the lens lens allows me to access it without any obstruction and having and being able to turn it counterclockwise makes sense if I'm holding it with my left hand because again it's not my the the tripod collar is not getting in the way so I get that my only gripe is because it's at the end of the barrel and the zoom ring is on the stiffer side zooming the lens in the hand causes me to be a little bit more shaky when I am doing that compared to the Sony but that's not really a big deal now I didn't get a chance to really like test this lens shooting what I normally do and shoot portraits but I did take some photos of some doggies at the dog park testing out the image quality and autofocus now this 70 to 20000 has a floating Focus mechanism just like the Sony which means that you're getting extremely fast autofocus and doing a couple tests in the studio like the lens pretty much focused like instantly with no no hesitation just like the Sony my hit rate shooting the dogs using the A1 at 30 frames per second it was pretty solid I I will say this the one advantage that I feel the Sony has with autofocus is when you're rack zooming so the Sony does a better job maintaining autofocus when I'm taking pictures and at the same time I'm rack zooming the lens the sigma struggled a little bit there now what about image quality comparing the images I can say that there was not much of a difference between the two like the in terms of sharpness they look identical background blur they both have 11 aperture blades they look really similar they look really good if you were to show me these images without telling me what lens I used I I would have guessed that they were shot with a prime lens because they it is that good Focus breathing is pretty much non-existent on either of these lenses my Sony A1 does not have Focus breathing compensation yet cuz it's coming soon but it doesn't matter because whether I have the Sony or the sigma on here the sigma has virtually zero Focus breathing it's very impressive now what about lens construction the Sigma 70 to 200 has 20 elements in 15 groups six lld exclusive low dispersion elements two sld exclusive low dispersion ele no three yeah oh damn I'm the teleprompt is going too fast let's try this again what about lens construction the Sigma 70 to 200 has 20 elements in 15 groups six lld exclusive low dispersion elements two sld exclusive low dispersion elements three aspherical elements 11 aperture blades and a 77 mm filter thread same as the Sony and it weighs 13 three 1,335 grams now it is about 300 grams heavier than the GM version 2 and about 100 grams lighter than the version one on the Sigma 70 to 200 we have a lot of switches and buttons so here we have a focus ammf switch we have a range limiter switch an optical stabilization switch a custom switch we have an aperture ring with the click on and off and we have a aperture lock ring on the other side along with three customizable buttons along the zoom ring it's also a slightly taller lens than the G Master but not by much now up until this point Sony users haven't had many options when it came to telephoto zoom lenses which is weird because for some focal links we have like five different options you know the only other option out there was the is the tamarra 70 to 180 um now we have a solid alternative a direct alternative to the 70 to 200 for a lot less money I'm talking $1200 less and the teleprompt is going too fast again with the sigma now we have a solid alternative to the 70 to 200 g Master for a lot less money like $1,200 less and you're getting very comparable results and performance I think this is really impressive and I think this lens is going to sell really well all right well it's the day before the launch and I now have to edit this video for tomorrow and I'm literally I was literally a walking zombie today all righty here we go"
