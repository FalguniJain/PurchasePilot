            "body": "I\u2019ve preordered P9ProXL, but decided to play with the device in Best Buy first. What can I say\u2026 It\u2019s very similar to iPhone 15pm, screen is really really bright, I can\u2019t say the colors are amazing though. Somehow I like the colors on S24u better. I was shocked that camera takes so much time to take a shot. It\u2019s like you press a shutter button and it spins for like 500ms. It\u2019s much better on both iPhone and Smasnug! Photos are good as far as I could tell, but need to wait for full reviews to come out. Snappiness is\u2026 Not good. Sorry. S24u is miles ahead. Somehow it got stuttered in random places while scrolling. Screenshots app did not work - it kept saying nothing found. Studio app - Not sure what\u2019s the point of Gemini app just generates the same pictures? It also said that it could not generate people. Recorder app - I could not find how to generate a summary of conversation recorded. In photos app there was no option to try that generation feature with prompt. Weather app is a joke. As an AI summary it said - \u201cit will get colder in the next 4 days\u201d\u2026 Emm, I sorta can see it? Absolutely useless\u2026 Gemini Live (chat) was also not available on the demo unit..\n\nI\u2019ve canceled my preorder as I was really disappointed. They sounded like it\u2019s a premium phone that can compete with flagships during the presentation . In reality.. IDK.. I highly HIGHLY! recommend going to the nearest Best Buy and give it a good try. For me the phone felt like a ~$700 phone at max. $1199 is not its price. \n\nJust to make it clear I was comparing it with s24u and iPhone 15pm that I currently own. Was thinking to trade in s24u as the camera is trash in low light. But s24u is much much snappier\u2026 Will see what ai features will make it way to other devices :) But I have a suspicion that if you pay for Gemini you\u2019ll get a lot of them. ",
